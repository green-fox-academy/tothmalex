            <h2> Software developer </h2>

            <p> I am a student currently attending a softwer developer course 
            and finishing my MSc studies. Next year I intend to take intenrship at BlackRock in Budapest.</p>
            <p> I was sure about that programming knowledge was going to 
            be essential in the future, especially in the financial sector.</p>

            <h4> Logic gate </h4>
            <p> It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; 
            that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and 
            produces a single binary output. </p>
            
            <h4> ASCII</h4>
            <p> It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand 
            numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
                
            <h4> Random-access memory</h4>
            <p> It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general 
            speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time
            irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
           
            <h4> Programming language</h4>
            <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. 
            They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
                
            <h4> Domain Name System </h4>
            <p> A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. 
            It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>

            <h4> Hypertext Transfer Protocol </h4>
            <p> An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication 
            for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext. </p>
